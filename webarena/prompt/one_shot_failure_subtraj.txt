OUTPUT:
<VALIDITY> True
<EXPLANATION> 
It does not depend on a previous action and is a complete action in itself
<CORRECTNESS> False
<EXPLANATION> 
The repeated sub-trajectory in the trajectory does not change the state of the webpage nor does it make progress towards the goal.
<NATURAL_LANG_QUERY> To change the mode of transport from "Car" to "Foot". However, this intention is not acheived by the sub-trajectory. To acheive it correctly, avoid these redundant steps and replan accordingly.
