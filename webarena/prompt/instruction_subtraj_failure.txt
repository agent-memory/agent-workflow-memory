Given the below trajectories for a web navigating agent including its thoughts and actions - each action is compose of a certain number of steps. We provide a sub-trajectory where each step is denoted by its corresponding elements/button which are present in these trajectories, decide if this is a valid and successful sub-trajectory given the complete trajectory. Output if it is a valid sub-trajectory or not and the suitable explanation. If it is a valid sub-trajectory, decide if it is successful or a failure. If it is successful, create a suitable 1-line natural language query for the sub-task which is solved by the sub-trajectory - this should be a generalized description of the sub-trajectory and can be adapted from the main query. If it is a failure, in addition to the natural language intent of the sub-trajectory, also output feedback on how this can be corrected to acheive the intended outcome. Also extract all the think and steps of the corresponding sub-trajectory. If the subtrajectory spans multiple thought and action pairs, copy all of them. If it spans only a subset of steps in a single action, modify the thought of that action to only be based on the steps in the sub-trajectory. Output all of the steps present in the subtrajectory given below, but do not include any extra steps.

Condition for a valid sub-trajectory:
It is a valid and complete set of actions in itself, is not a continuation or relies on the previous step to be meaningfully completed

Condition for a successful sub-trajectory:
It contributes meaningfully to the trajectory to attain the final goal and leads to a change in state of the web environment, i.e. the action ends up displaying a new page, sending some input etc. If there is a change, it will be reflected in the model's next think step as it observes the updated change in the web environment.
